Code Relay:

Task #7:
Remove MResult from printer sixel. Make it all ViuResult

Task #6:

Make SixlPrinter print return a ViuResult instead of an MResult

Task #5;

Make a SixlPrinter struct and implement printer using
sixel_print. (in printer/sixel)

Task #4:

- Get print_sixel to compile. Get type definitions from 
https://github.com/rabite0/hunter/blob/355d9a3101f6d8dc375807de79e368602f1cb87d/src/hunter-media.rs#L714-L745

Added print_sixel to printer::mod.rs

Task #3:
Task 2 was not completed as mentioned by author, so I actually added sixel to cargo.

Still need to complete sixel.rs, looking at example in issue. Right now sixel.rs is just a copy of kitty.rs

Task #2:
Implement this
https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/issues/4#issue-712252749
* already added sixel to cargo
* Complete sixel.rs, look at example in issue

# viuer
Display images in the terminal with ease.

![ci](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

`viuer` is a Rust library that makes it easy to show images in the
terminal. It has a straightforward interface and is configured
through a single struct. The default printing method is through
lower half blocks (â–„ or \u2585). However some custom graphics
protocols are supported. They result in full resolution images
being displayed in specific environments:

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol.html)
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)

For a demo of the library's usage and example screenshots, see [`viu`](https://github.com/atanunq/viu).

## Examples

```toml
# in Cargo.toml, under [dependencies]
viuer = "0.3"
```
```rust
// in src/main.rs
use viuer::{print_from_file, Config};

fn main() {
    let conf = Config {
        // set offset
        x: 20,
        y: 4,
        // set dimensions
        width: Some(80),
        height: Some(25),
        ..Default::default()
    };

    // starting from row 4 and column 20,
    // display `img.jpg` with dimensions 80x25 (in terminal cells)
    // note that the actual resolution in the terminal will be 80x50
    print_from_file("img.jpg", &conf).expect("Image printing failed.");
}
```

Or if you have a [DynamicImage](https://docs.rs/image/*/image/enum.DynamicImage.html), you can use it directly:
```rust
// ..Config setup

let img = image::DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(image::RgbaImage::new(20, 10));
viuer::print(&img, &conf).expect("Image printing failed.");
```
