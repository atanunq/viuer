Task #13:
Complete sixel::check_sixel_support
Check for sixel compatibility in the main print method. If that is the case, call SixelPrinter, which lives in sixel.rs and implements the Printer trait.
- Look at the terminal requirements for libsixel https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel#terminal-requirements

- This comment on mintty claims "one can detect SIXEL capability using an escape sequence" https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/866#issuecomment-482781112. Find out what that escape sequence is
- Found it  https://github.com/gizak/termui/pull/233#issuecomment-478193544
the important ANSI escape strings here are:

"\033[0c" for querying the terminal capabilities - we need a 4 for sixel.

We also need to know what the size of a character box is in pixels this differs from terminal to terminal:

"\033[14t" gives us the terminal size in pixels

"\033[18t" gives us the terminal size in cells

from that we can calculate the cell size in pixels.

We set the position with "\033[%d;%dH" before printing the sixel string. the position string is simply prepended.

The first %d is the Y position (in cells) and the second the X position.\
- Find a way to read value in from terminal after running escape code to check if it is 4

Task #8:

Add SixelError to impl std::fmt::Display for ViuError .


Task #7:
Remove MResult from printer sixel. Make it all ViuResult

Task #6:

Make SixlPrinter print return a ViuResult instead of an MResult

Task #5;

Make a SixlPrinter struct and implement printer using
sixel_print. (in printer/sixel)

Task #4:

- Get print_sixel to compile. Get type definitions from 
https://github.com/rabite0/hunter/blob/355d9a3101f6d8dc375807de79e368602f1cb87d/src/hunter-media.rs#L714-L745

Added print_sixel to printer::mod.rs

Task #3:
Task 2 was not completed as mentioned by author, so I actually added sixel to cargo.

Still need to complete sixel.rs, looking at example in issue. Right now sixel.rs is just a copy of kitty.rs

Task #2:
Implement this
https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/issues/4#issue-712252749
* already added sixel to cargo
* Complete sixel.rs, look at example in issue

# viuer
Display images in the terminal with ease.

![ci](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

`viuer` is a Rust library that makes it easy to show images in the
terminal. It has a straightforward interface and is configured
through a single struct. The default printing method is through
lower half blocks (â–„ or \u2585). However some custom graphics
protocols are supported. They result in full resolution images
being displayed in specific environments:

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol.html)
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)

For a demo of the library's usage and example screenshots, see [`viu`](https://github.com/atanunq/viu).

## Examples

```toml
# in Cargo.toml, under [dependencies]
viuer = "0.3"
```
```rust
// in src/main.rs
use viuer::{print_from_file, Config};

fn main() {
    let conf = Config {
        // set offset
        x: 20,
        y: 4,
        // set dimensions
        width: Some(80),
        height: Some(25),
        ..Default::default()
    };

    // starting from row 4 and column 20,
    // display `img.jpg` with dimensions 80x25 (in terminal cells)
    // note that the actual resolution in the terminal will be 80x50
    print_from_file("img.jpg", &conf).expect("Image printing failed.");
}
```

Or if you have a [DynamicImage](https://docs.rs/image/*/image/enum.DynamicImage.html), you can use it directly:
```rust
// ..Config setup

let img = image::DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(image::RgbaImage::new(20, 10));
viuer::print(&img, &conf).expect("Image printing failed.");
```

Check the [full documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/viuer) for examples and all the configuration options.
